# C++ Fundamentals

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-learning--repository-blue?style=flat-square)]()

## Overview

This repository is **not a portfolio**.  
It is a **personal learning repository** created to systematically study and organize fundamental C++ concepts.

I am using this project to deepen my understanding of basic C++ syntax, data structures, algorithms, and language features.

## Purpose

- To learn and practice basic C++ syntax and concepts.
- To document my learning journey with clear, small examples.
- To have a reference I can review when needed in the future.

## Important Notes

- **This repository is not intended to showcase production-level code.**
- **The examples focus on simplicity and clarity rather than optimization or engineering best practices.**
- Some files may contain repetitive or similar content to reinforce learning.

## Topics Covered (so far)

- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if, for, while, switch)
- Functions
- Pointers and memory management
- Classes and objects
- smart pointers
- Standard Template Library (STL)

Feel free to browse the code, but please note that it reflects a learning process rather than polished development.
